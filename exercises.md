### Exercises

You’ll find exercises sprinkled throughout this book. To become familiar with
a language, you need to go beyond reading a book and following along with
the examples; you need to write some code yourself. These exercises are

starting points so you can do some exploring of the language. Try them out,
and don’t be afraid to make mistakes.

#### Think Different(ly)
This is a book about thinking differently—about accepting that some of the
things folks say about programming may not be the full story:

• Object orientation is not the only way to design code.
• Functional programming need not be complex or mathematical.
• The bases of programming are not assignments, if statements, and loops.
• Concurrency does not need locks, semaphores, monitors, and the like.
• Processes are not necessarily expensive resources.
• Metaprogramming is not just something tacked onto a language.
• Even if it is work, programming should be fun.

Of course, I’m not saying Elixir is a magic potion (well, technically it is, but
you know what I mean). It isn’t the one true way to write code. But it’s different
enough from the mainstream that learning it will give you more perspective
and will open your mind to new ways of thinking about programming.

So let’s start.

And remember to make it fun.
