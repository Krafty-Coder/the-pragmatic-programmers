# ➤ Exercise: ListsAndRecursion-1
# Write a mapsum function that takes a list and a function. It applies the
# function to each element of the list and then sums the result, so
# iex> MyList.mapsum [1, 2, 3], &(&1 * &1)
# 14

# ➤ Exercise: ListsAndRecursion-2
# Write a max(list) that returns the element with the maximum value in the
# list. (This is slightly trickier than it sounds.)
# An Elixir single-quoted string is actually a list of individual character
# codes. Write a caesar(list, n) function that adds n to each list element,
# wrapping if the addition results in a character greater than z.
# iex> MyList.caesar('ryvkve', 13)
# ?????? :)
